## Description
{This application is part of my self taught journey to becoming a programmer. The app allows you to open an account by filling in a form firstname, lastname, and initial deposit fields. Once a user clicks the open account button a box appear on the far right side with the user details as provided when opening the account. once a user signs up, ofcourse there is no database at this time, they will see a withdraw and deposit buttons. once a user clicks on any of the buttons the initial open account form and button disappears and user can now withdraw or deposit cash and see it in real time on the far right side. }
